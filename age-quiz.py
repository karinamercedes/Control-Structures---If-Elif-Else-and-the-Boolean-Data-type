# ● Create a new Python file called age-quiz.py. The program you create in
#   this file will be used to output a variety of responses determined by the
#   data the user enters.
# ● If the user is 40 or over, output the message "You're over the hill."
# ● Write code to take in a user’s age and store it in an integer variable called
#   age.
# ● Assume that the oldest someone can be is 100; if the user enters a
#   higher number, output the message "Sorry, you're dead.".
# ● If the user is 65 or older, output the message "Enjoy your retirement!"
# ● If the user is under 13, output the message "You qualify for the kiddie
#   discount."
# ● If the user is 21, output the message "Congrats on your 21st!"
# ● For any other age, output the message "Age is but a number."
# ● Tips:
#   o You should use the if-elif-else statement structure to create the
#     program.
#   o Note that the order in which you set up the conditions is
#     important; you will need to work out what makes sense in terms
#      of the logical tests applied to the ages.

#num = int(input("Please input a number between 1 and 100"))
#if num < 12: # Don’t forget the colon!
#print("The value you entered is lower than 12")

# Ask the user to enter the age
age = int(input("Please enter you age: "))

# Conditions

    print("Sorry, you're dead.")
